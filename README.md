# Hotel Ranking

This is a hotel directory application that allows users to maintain a list of their favourite hotels and hotel brands.

## Features

* Users can add a hotel to a brand.
* Users can filter the list of hotels by brands.
* Users can search through the list of hotels and hotel brands.
* The hotels/hotel brands data is persisted even after closing the app.

## Tools/Technologies Used
* React (Next.js)
* Chakra UI
* Typescript
* Local Storage

## Improvements
The hotel feature image upload functionality has not been implemented yet. Hence, a dummy image is used in the hotel listings.
